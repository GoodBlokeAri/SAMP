# SA-MP
This Repo will house all my code, projects ect from SA-MP. Most of the stuff in here won't be updated any further than it is.

For the most part this will only hold gamemode/filterscript code (.pwn, .cpp, .c, .inc and anything to run with SA-MP) so expect PAWN code but also C/C#/C++ or PHP even.


I'll document everything (eventually) on the git wiki


note: this won't hold any of my personal CLEO's, I might release these someday though.
